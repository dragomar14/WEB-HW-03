1)First part for threadsWrite a program to process the "Junk" folder that sorts files in the specified folder by their extensions using multiple threads.Speed up the processing of large directories with many nested folders and files by performing a parallel traversal of all folders in separate threads.The most time-consuming tasks will be moving the file and obtaining a list of files in the folder (iterating through the contents of the directory).To speed up file transfers, they can be performed in a separate thread or thread pool.This is especially convenient because the result of this operation is not processed in the application, and no results need to be collected.To speed up the traversal of directories with multiple levels of nesting, you can perform the processing of each subdirectory in a separate thread or pass the processing to a thread pool.2)Second part for processesWrite an implementation of the factorize function that takes a list of numbers and returns a list of numbers by which the numbers in the input list are divisible without a remainder.Implement a synchronous version and measure the execution time.Then improve the performance of your function by implementing the use of multiple processor cores for parallel computing, and measure the execution time again.To determine the number of cores on a machine, use the cpu_count() function from the multiprocessing package.
